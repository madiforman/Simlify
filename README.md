# Simlify

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to find out how similar or how different 2 users' music tastes are. This was a team project and the collaborators
are listed down below at the bottom of this ReadMe. Our application uses the public Spotify Web API to gather each user's music listening data and implement
the Cosine Similarity formula to calculate how similar your music taste is.
